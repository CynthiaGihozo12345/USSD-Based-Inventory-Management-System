•	Add new products to the system
•	Record stock coming in (Product In) by entering product Name, entering quantity, and price
•	Record stock going out (Product Out) by entering product name, entering quantity and price. 
•	View all products stored in Stocks
•	View all products stored
•	View all Stockin
•	View all stockout

Key Features
1.	Admin Registration

 Technologies Used
•	Backend: PHP
•	Database: MySQL
•	Platform: XAMPP (Local Server)
•	Interface: USSD logic via PHP (index.php and menu.php)
How It Works
1.	User dials a USSD code (e.g., *123#).
2.	index.php processes the request.
3.	menu.php navigates the user through menu options.
4.	The admin selects an action:
o	Add Product → Inputs name only.
o	Product In → Enter Product Name → Enter quantity.
o	Product Out →Enter Product Name → Enter quantity.
o	View Products,stock,stockin,stockout → Views list of all products.
5.	Each action interacts with the database and returns a simple text response.
